This repo contains training material, that I have used as part of my transition
towards Data Science/Machine Learning.

For the first half of my career (1998 - 2017), I worked as backend developer but
without really specializing on anything concrete. Today, companies demand a high
degree of specialization; hence I needed to finally pick a path. It has a kind
soul-searching process, but after a lot of meditation I chose Data Science (I am
assuming that Machine Learning is part of it). This decision was made is because
, this area seems to be a good intersection of desire and needs:

1) High amount of Applied Mathematics (which I always liked at school).
2) High visibility in today's industry (and the trend seems to be long term).

I also plan to contribute at real-life projects (separate repos), but under this
one you can find mostly academic exercises of courses I took. If you are looking
at the gitlab.com repo, I recommend that you switch instead to the github.com
mirror that I maintain (so you can read properly the mathematical content):

https://github.com/dariomx/data-science-learning

This is because the gitlab.com rendered for Jupyter Notebooks is a work in
progress; and the github.com is almost perfect now (just a new things do not
render properly). I heavily used the subset of LaTeX available in the Jupyter
Notebook markup language, for the math-like exercises; that is the main reason
behind this recommendation.

Cheers.
