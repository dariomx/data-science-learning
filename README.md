This repo contains training material that I have used at a time, when I
was interested in moving towards Data Science/Machine Learning.

If you are looking at the gitlab.com repo, I recommend that you switch 
instead to the github.com mirror that I maintain (so you can read 
properly the mathematical content):

https://github.com/dariomx/data-science-learning

This is because the gitlab.com rendered for Jupyter Notebooks is a work in
progress; and the github.com is almost perfect now (just a new things do not
render properly). I heavily used the subset of LaTeX available in the Jupyter
Notebook markup language, for the math-like exercises; that is the main reason
behind this recommendation.

Cheers.
