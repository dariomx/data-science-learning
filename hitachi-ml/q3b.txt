Yes, there is a level of uncertainty here, which can be appreciated by
the formula used:

p +/- z * SE

The term we are adding/substracting, z * SE, is usually called uncertainty
(well, well, at least in the context of tolerance intervals for normal data).
In particular the term z (z-score), depends on the confidence level we chose
to use here (95%). Hence, the more confidence we want for our interval, the
wider it is gonna become. The interpretation I recall for a confidence interval,
of confidence level q (say 95%), is that if we repeat the experiment (in this
case the sample of 500), like may times, thus q percentage of those samples
will yield a point estimate for our percentage (of detective items), which will
actually be within our interval.
