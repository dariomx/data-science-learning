I would use a confidence interval, say with 95 confidence level, around the
percentage of items with such defect. Looks like I have all the ingredients,
the interval itself would be:

p +/- z * SE = [0.05105476962852627, 0.09694523037147372] ~ [0.05, 0.1]

where

p = point estimate of the percentage, in our case that is the percentage
of defective items from the sample, that is, 37/500 = 0.074.

z = associated quantile for the normal distribution, which for 95% confidence
level (are under curve), shall be around points associated with 0.025. This
value is roughly 1.96

SE = standard error for the particular case of proportions. I believe this
is derived from the Central Limit Theorem, under some assumptions which I
will take as granted now for the sake of time (noon is approaching!). Hence,
under those assumptions we can consider that the proportion of items with
the defect behaves like a normal distribution; and that allows to use this
whole inferential framework, including this formula:

SE = sqrt((p * (1-p)) / n) = 0.011706750189527408 ~ 0.012

where n = sample size ... mmm, but we are not using population size?
Usually on the examples where I learned this technique, the total population
population size was unknown, but here I know it and thus sort of wasting it.
But let us forget that for a minute, cause again, time is short and gotta
deliver this.
