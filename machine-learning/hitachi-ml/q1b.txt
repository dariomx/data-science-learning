The heads seem to be naturally grouped per their ranges of temperature. We
can observe at least three ranges across both files:

group1: 164287
group2: 152109, 164371
group3: 152133, 164361

If we were for example, to build a linear model aiming to predict the temperature
at a given time; it would be probably better to do that per group. Mmm, actually,
we may just rather do it per head; that may be a more accurate model.

Trying to force a single model to deal with all these data may not be a good idea,
as the temperatures are clearly in disconnected ranges.
