  \begin{block}{}
    Looking for ideas for a Msc. Thesis
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Possibly apporting something to Oracle :)
    	\item Oracle bought \textit{Collaborative Intellect Inc.} in 2012
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Analytics engine that processes conversations from Social Networks
      	\item Users of this product can know if user's posts in Social Networks are associated with certain topics
      \item Tens of Millions of conversations in a day!
      \item Social Networks produce Hundreds of Millions!
      \item Requires LSI!
    \end{itemize}
     \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Statement of the Problem}
  \begin{block}{}
  \textit{Given the fact that modern LSI applications require end to end
processing of hundreds of millions of documents every day, in a streamed
updatable fashion, how can the particular SVD step be optimized through parallel
or distributed computing?}
