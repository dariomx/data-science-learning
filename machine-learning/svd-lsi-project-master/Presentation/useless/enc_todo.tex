	\begin{block}{Learn about Tensors}
    Seems to be part of Multi-linear Algebra (and quite interesting,
    btw). 
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Learn about tensor decomposition}
    At least the PARAFAC implementation used by Gigatensor, so we have
    something to compare against.
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Understand Gigatensor optimizations}
    ``Heavy'' article for newcomers like us, but hopefully easier
    after reading about above two topics.
