	\frametitle{What Gigatensor brings? [Kang12]}
	\begin{block}{Algorithm}
    A large scale tensor
    decomposition algorithm on MAP REDUCE. Is carefully designed to
    minimize the intermediate data size 
    and the number of floating point operations.
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Scalability}
    It decomposes 100$\times$ larger tensors
    compared to existing methods. Furthermore, GIGATENSOR enjoys
    near linear scalability on the number of machines.
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Map Reduce implementation}
    GIGATENSOR can handle Tera-scale tensors using the MAP REDUCE
    framework,  and more specifically its open source implementation,
    HADOOP (first time this was done).
	\end{block}
