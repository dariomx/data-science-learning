	\begin{block}{A problem is well conditioned if ... }
    $x \simeq (x+\delta) \implies f(x) \simeq f(x + \delta)$
	\end{block}   
	\begin{block}{Weyl's Theorem}
    $\abs{\tilde{\sigma_i} - \sigma_i} \le \norm{E}_2 \ds{\suchthat}
    \tilde{A} = A + E$
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Wedin's Theorem}
    The singular vectors subproblem is not well conditioned in theory,
    but it has bounds.
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{In practice we are fine}
    We do not need singular vectors by themselves ($\vec{v} =
    \inv{\Sigma}\trans{U}\vec{x}$).
