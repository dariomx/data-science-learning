\section{The intuition behind SVD}

In this section we will provide several informal ways of looking at
the SVD factorization, aiming to ignite the formal discussion of next
section (where we prove the SVD theorem). \\

Although the geometrical interpretation works great for a simple
example in \R{2}, there are a couple of missing details in the action of
matrix $\Sigma$ which are worth mentioning. The first, is that the
dimensions of $\Sigma$ are those of the original matrix ($n \times
m$); therefore, its action is not only expanding or contracting, but
also a migration of space (from \R{n} to \R{m}). If there are more
rows than columns ($m > n$), the transformation $\Sigma$ will produce
a bigger vector than its input (the diagonal entries beyond position
$n$ will be zeroes, which in turn will fill the new vector entries
with zeroes as well; up to $m$ entries). If on the contrary we have
more columns than rows ($m < n$), then the effect will be a truncation
of the input vector (resulting vector has as many entries as rows in
$\Sigma$). In our example, this change of space was not perceived, as $n
= m$. \\

The second omitted detail about the action of $\Sigma$ in 
\cref{fig:svd-geo-diag}, is even more subtle: along with the migration
of space \R{n} to space \R{m}, we are also changing the basis; from
$\{\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},\dots,\vec{v_n}\}$ to
$\{\vec{u_1},\vec{u_2},\dots,\vec{u_m}\}$. This additional effect may
not be evident at all, but is thanks to an additional property that
is required on the two basis for the SVD factorization to hold:

\[
A\vec{v_i} = \sigma_i\vec{u_i}, \ds{}\forall i=1 \dots r, \ds{}\text{where
} r = rank(A).
\]
\hfill

The above property tells us that the vectors from the two basis were
picked in a very special way: each vector \vec{u_i} is parallel to the
image under $A$ of its associated \vec{v_i}; in other words, the
transformation $A$ maps the \R{n} basis
$\{\vec{v_1},\dots\,\vec{v_n}\}$, into vectors which are parallel to
the \R{m} basis $\{\vec{u_1},\dots\,\vec{u_m}\}$. Given that both basis
are orthonormal, a consequence from this observation is that the
orthogonality of the basis $\{\vec{v_1},\dots\,\vec{v_n}\}$ is preserved
under $A$ (\cite{kalman96}). This is not a trivial property, and not
every basis has it (given $A$ is assumed to be given). This is
actually the key problem of the SVD factorization, and the proofs
provided in the next section, focus around the problem of finding such
special basis.
