This data was compiled from the great data-set made available by Alex Olteanu at github:

https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17/

Such data is in turn, related to an interesting article posted at:

https://medium.freecodecamp.org/whose-reviews-should-you-trust-imdb-rotten-tomatoes-metacritic-or-fandango-7d1010c6cf19

Alex does not put any license terms over his data, hence the data
I am putting here inherits whatever terms he decides (contacting
him over email to ask about it).

In the meantime I am just publishing to allow reviewers to grade my
linear regression project at coursera (part of the Statistics with R specialization)
