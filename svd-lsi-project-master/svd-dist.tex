\chapter{Distributed SVD algorithm}
\label{cha:svd-dist}

In the previous chapter we discussed the state of the art, regarding
the serial version of the SVD algorithm, on the context of the LSI
problem; such algorithm was discussed under the assumption that
the matrix and auxiliary artifacts fit into the RAM of such
computer. We also mentioned that such algorithm, could benefit from
parallel or vectorized linear algebra kernels; speciall for its most
expensive operations (like the sparse matrix-vector
multiplication). In this chapter, we will discuss a chosen distributed version
of SVD algorithm; where the calculation is spread across computing
nodes in a cluster, aiming mainly to scale in time (due the inherent
parallelization). \\

The most scalable and documented algorithm for SVD-LSI, that we found
in literature, was that of Radim \Rehurek; who published his results
into a series of articles (\cite{rehurek10a},
\cite{rehurek10b} and \cite{rehurek11b}), and culminated the effort
with his PhD thesis (\cite{rehurek11a}). All the articles are
  pretty much contained  in \Rehurek's Phd thesis, then unless stated
  explicitly, all the references to his work in this chapter will be
  from that publication. Is is 
fair to emphasize though, that \Rehurek thesis covers other topics
besides those we care about in this project; thus, we focused on his
chapter of SVD/LSI only. \\

Another pertinent clarification about \Rehurek's work, is that he
offers the distributed algorithm mostly as a way of speeding up the
SVD calculation (scale in time); and not precisely for tackling bigger
problems that simply do not fit in the memory of a single computer
(scale in space). On the large scale experiments that he reports, the
resulting matrix can pretty much fit into the RAM of a modern personal computer;
actually, he uses that to compare the reduction in time on the serial
execution (single machine) vs the distributed execution (cluster).
