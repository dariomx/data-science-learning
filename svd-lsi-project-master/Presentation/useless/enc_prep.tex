      First, we need to tokenize the raw text; that is, we need to decide
      what constitutes a term and how to extract terms from raw text. 
		\end{block} 
		\begin{block}{}
      Second, we may want to normalize the raw text, to convert
      superficially different strings of characters to the same form (e.g.,
      car, Car, cars, and Cars could all be normalized to car).  
		\end{block} 
		\begin{block}{}
      Third, we may want to annotate the raw text, to mark identical
      strings of characters as being different (e.g., fly as a verb
      could be annotated as fly/VB and fly as a noun could be
      annotated as fly/NN).
