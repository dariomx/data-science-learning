	\begin{block}{Can we beat Matlab?}
    We compare the scalability of GIGATENSOR and the Tensor
    Toolbox for Matlab which is the current state of the art in terms 
    of handling fast and effectively sparse tensors. The Tensor Toolbox
    is executed in a machine with a quad-core AMD 2.8 GHz CPU,
    32 GB RAM, and 2.3 Terabytes disk. To run GIGATENSOR, we
    use CMUâ€™s OpenCloud HADOOP cluster where each machine has
    2 quad-core Intel 2.83 GHz CPU, 16 GB RAM, and 4 Terabytes
    disk.
