	\begin{block}{Contextual Synonym Detection}
    We analyzed a knowledge base dataset, coming from the ``Read the
    Web'' project [Carson10]; this dataset recorded (noun-phrase, noun-phrase,
    context) relationships ...; the size of
    the tensor was 26M $\times$ 26M $\times$ 48M , which made it
    prohibitive to analyze, for any existing tool. After obtaining the
    PARAFAC decomposition, we 
    were able to perform contextual synonym detection, i.e. detect
    noun-phrases that may be used in similar contexts. Using cosine
    similarity, we took the low dimensional representation of each
    noun-phrase, as expressed by matrix A, and we calculated the
    similarity of each    noun-phrase to the rest. In this way, we
    were able to obtain noun-phrases that are contextually similar,
    albeit not synonyms in the 
    traditional sense.
