We found that the following is still required:
\begin{itemize}
\item Need a modern sensible experiment that compares GenSim against
  other modern SVD parallel/distributed algorithms (which may not focus
  exclusively LSI problem).
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare against Mahout, SLEPc, LingPipe, GraphLab, etc.
\item Use experiments similar to those that Rehurek did. 
\item Need to use much more documents and more nodes in the cluster
\item Could get benchmark matrices used by Oracle's Product.
\end{itemize}
\item For the case of Rehurek's, profiling experiments similar to those made by Berry, could help identify bottlenecks
\begin{itemize}
\item Base case SVD
\item Merge Algorithm
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Need to research whether Rehurek's merge algorithm is optimal or not
\item Need to try other merge alternatives
\item Need an experiment with different implementations of the base case SVD solver
\begin{itemize}
\item Could try parallel versions of SVDLIBC (BLAS/LAPACK)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
