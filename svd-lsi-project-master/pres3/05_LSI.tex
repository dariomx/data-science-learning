  \frametitle{Latent Semantic Indexing and the Truncated SVD}
  \begin{block}{}
  According to Deerwester et al. there is a latent space
where documents and indexed terms are expresed with $r$ features.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $A = U \Sigma V^{T}$
    \item $U$ is the matrix of terms
    \item $V$ is the matrix of documents
    \item $\Sigma$ contains $r$ singular values
  \end{itemize}

  The smallest singular values are actually noise and we can
get rid of them. 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item By doing so we get $A_k = U_k \Sigma_k V_k^{T}$
    \item That allows to compare documents against user queries
(pseudo-documents), addressing the polysemy/synonymy issues.
    \item This step is justified by Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem 
\begin{equation} 
\min_{\{Z|rank(Z)=k\}} \|A-Z\|_{2} = \|A-A_{k}\|_{2} = \sigma_{k+1}
\end{equation}
  \end{itemize}
