\begin{block}{}
$A = U \Sigma V^{T}$
\begin{itemize}
  \item $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices
  \item $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix that contain the \textit{singular values} $\sigma_i$ of
A; $\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq ... \geq \sigma_n \geq 0$
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
In the 20th century, focus was on obtaining efficient algorithms for SVD
computation
\begin{itemize}
  \item Several implementations of SVD solvers
  \begin{itemize}
    \item SVDPACK(C)
    \item SVDLIBC
    \item LAPACK
    \item ...
  \end{itemize}
  \item Gensim contains the SVD solver that best matches our problem (as far as we could investigate)
\end{itemize}
