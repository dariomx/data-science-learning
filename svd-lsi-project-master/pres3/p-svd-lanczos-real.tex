	\begin{block}{Is it numerically stable?}
    No, the tridiagonalization step needs to be rewritten (thanks Paige!).
	\end{block}   
	\begin{block}{Is orthogonality really guaranteed?}
    No, it is lost as $\beta_k$ becomes small (thanks again
    Paige!). Selective re-orthogonalization is required 
    (thanks to Parlett and Simon).
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{What to do then?}
    Berry's implementation, LASVD/LAS2, consider all aspects above;
    including performance (parallelization).
